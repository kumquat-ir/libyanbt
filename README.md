Yet Another NBT Library

Not because another one was necessary, but because I wanted to make one.

Calling this 0.1 right now, but no actual releases or docs until I know it works

Supports:
- Reading and writing uncompressed or gzipped nbt files
- Printing contents of nbt file
- Editing tags (needs testing)
- Adding/removing tags (also needs testing)

Does not support:
- zlib compression
- Region (.mca/.mcr) files
- Bedrock nbt files
- Compiling on non-Linux platforms
- Some invalid files
